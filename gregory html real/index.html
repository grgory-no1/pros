        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>
          At Play Forward, we believe that every child deserves the 
          opportunity to engage in sports and physical activity. Our
          mission is to support small sports clubs by providing essential
           sports equipment, ensuring that financial barriers do not hinder
          participation. By partnering with local organizations and communities, 
          we aim to foster teamwork, build confidence, and promote healthy lifestyles. 
          Together, we’re creating a brighter future where every young athlete has the 
          tools they need to thrive on and off the field.

        <p>
          Over the past year, we have successfully distributed over 
          5,000 pieces of sports equipment to more than 150 small sports 
          clubs in the UK, enabling thousands of children to participate in organized
           sports. Our initiatives have not only increased access to quality
          gear but also fostered inclusivity, with many clubs reporting higher
           participation rates among underrepresented groups. Additionally,
           we’ve seen firsthand the positive impact on youth development,
           as kids build teamwork skills, boost their confidence,
           and cultivate a lifelong love for physical activity.
